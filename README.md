# Breast Cancer Prediction Using Ensemble Learning
# Overview

This project implements an ensemble machine learning approach to predict breast cancer diagnosis based on biopsy data. Multiple machine learning models are trained and evaluated individually, and then combined using a Voting Classifier to improve prediction accuracy. The goal is to distinguish between Malignant (cancerous) and Benign (non-cancerous) tumors.

# Technologies Used

    Python
    Pandas & NumPy (for data manipulation)
    Matplotlib (for visualization)
    Scikit-Learn (for machine learning algorithms)

# Dataset

The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset. It consists of various features extracted from digitized images of breast mass biopsies.

# Project Workflow
# 1. Data Preprocessing

    Load dataset using Pandas.
    Drop unnecessary columns (e.g., ID).
    Encode the target variable (Malignant = 1, Benign = 0).
    Split dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
    Normalize feature values using StandardScaler.

# 2. Training Individual Models

The following models are trained individually to analyze their performance:

    Logistic Regression (Linear model for classification)
    Decision Tree Classifier (Tree-based model for feature splits)
    Random Forest Classifier (Ensemble of decision trees)
    Gradient Boosting Classifier (Boosting algorithm to improve weak models)
    Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Finds optimal decision boundary)

# 3. Ensemble Learning with Voting Classifier

To improve accuracy, we combine the above models using Soft Voting, where models contribute based on their probability scores.

# 4. Performance Evaluation

Each model's performance is evaluated using:

    Accuracy Score (Correct predictions/Total predictions)
    ROC-AUC Score (How well the model differentiates between classes)
    Classification Report (Precision, Recall, and F1-Score for each class)

# 5. Visualization

A bar chart is generated comparing the accuracy and ROC-AUC scores of all models.

# 6. User Input & Prediction

The model allows users to input biopsy features manually, and predicts whether the tumor is Malignant or Benign along with a confidence score.
Usage

    Run the script to train models and evaluate their performance.
    Enter user input when prompted to get a cancer diagnosis prediction.
    Analyze the generated bar chart for model comparison.

# Results

    The ensemble model achieved the highest accuracy and ROC-AUC score compared to individual models.
    Soft voting improved the overall classification performance by leveraging the strengths of multiple models.

# Future Improvements

    Implement more advanced ensemble techniques (e.g., Stacking, Bagging).
    Incorporate deep learning (Neural Networks) for improved accuracy.
    Deploy as a web-based application for user-friendly access.
